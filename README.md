# Calcy
Hello there! Welcome to the Advanced Calculator!

Project Evolution and Production Readiness
I started this project as an advanced calculator built with a command pattern, REPL loop, and a dynamic plugin architecture. In this latest version, I enhanced the application for production readiness by:

Logging: Integrated Pythonâ€™s built-in logging to capture runtime events both on the console and in a log file (app.log).
Environment Variables: Implemented configuration management with a .env file (using python-dotenv), ensuring sensitive information remains secure.
Continuous Integration: Added a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically run tests on every push to the main branch.
For more details on additional functionalities, please check the other branches.
